    "## Recursion\n",
    "Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. For instance, when the surfaces of two mirrors are exactly parallel with each other, the nested images that occur are a form of infinite recursion. The term has a variety of meanings specific to a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, in which it refers to a method of defining functions in which the function being defined is applied within its own definition. Specifically, this defines an infinite number of instances (function values), using a finite expression that for some instances may refer to other instances, but in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur. The term is also used more generally to describe a process of repeating objects in a self-similar way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal definitions \n",
    "In mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A simple base case (or cases)—a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer\n",
    "- A set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the base case\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One's parents are one's ancestors (base case).\n",
    "- The ancestors of one's ancestors are also one's ancestors (recursion step)."

    "##09) The Cantor Set\n",
    "In mathematics, the Cantor set is a set of points lying on a single line segment that has a number of remarkable and deep properties. It was discovered in 1874 by Henry John Stephen Smith and introduced by German mathematician Georg Cantor in 1883.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through consideration of this set, Cantor and others helped lay the foundations of modern point-set topology. Although Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, the most common modern construction is the Cantor ternary set, built by removing the middle thirds of a line segment. Cantor himself only mentioned the ternary construction in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a perfect set that is nowhere dense.\n",
