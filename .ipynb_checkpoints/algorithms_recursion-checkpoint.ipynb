    "## Recursion\n",
    "Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. For instance, when the surfaces of two mirrors are exactly parallel with each other, the nested images that occur are a form of infinite recursion. The term has a variety of meanings specific to a variety of disciplines ranging from linguistics to logic. The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, in which it refers to a method of defining functions in which the function being defined is applied within its own definition. Specifically, this defines an infinite number of instances (function values), using a finite expression that for some instances may refer to other instances, but in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur. The term is also used more generally to describe a process of repeating objects in a self-similar way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal definitions \n",
    "In mathematics and computer science, a class of objects or methods exhibit recursive behavior when they can be defined by two properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A simple base case (or cases)—a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer\n",
    "- A set of rules that reduce all other cases toward the base case\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following is a recursive definition of a person's ancestors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One's parents are one's ancestors (base case).\n",
    "- The ancestors of one's ancestors are also one's ancestors (recursion step)."
